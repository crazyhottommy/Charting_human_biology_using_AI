    "section": "",
    "text": "The human biology is arguably one of the most precious complex systems in existence that is both multi-scale and highly dynamic in nature. Though a full understanding of such a system eludes us at the present, modern medicine relies on sophisticated biosensors and data analytics methods. Generation of actionable insights into health and disease requires an interdisciplinary effort bringing together domain scientists and technologists.\nWith the unprecedented growth of available molecular assays (e.g. single cell m’omics, spatial omics, proteogenomics, and so on) and increasing availability of real world data, there is an essential need to develop methods and expertise in multi-omics analysis and integration, specially using ML/AI to bring together prior knowledge, disease biology and clinical data to actionable insights for drug discovery, diagnostics and prediction of response and resistance to treatments.\nIn this workshop, we will focus on multi-omics technologies and corresponding novel analytics approaches to help build integrative models of the systems biology in order to understand the healthy state and transition into a disease state, and how that differs between subgroups of individuals leading to development of more effective interventions specific to each subgroup."

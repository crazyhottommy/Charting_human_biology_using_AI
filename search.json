    "text": "Organization Team\nThe following colleagues will serve on the organization committee\n\nIlknur Icke, PhD, Director of Applied Machine Learning, Bayer, ilknur.icke@bayer.com\nIlknur is interested in the study of complex systems, at the intersection of sensing and computational modeling for better understanding and interventions. Her prior experience includes active learning based design of real-time fMRI experiments and computational modeling of such experiments to study human brain. Ilknur has been in the pharmaceuticals R&D domain for almost a decade working in highly interdisciplinary teams developing capabilities in such areas as modeling & simulation tools for PK/PD analysis, molecular imaging applications for neuroscience and oncology, as well as analysis of multi-omics data and generative modeling for de-novo compound design. She has run a company-wide Quantum Computing focus group bringing together internal and external colleagues. Ilknur also has been serving as a reviewer for the MICCAI conference.\n\n\nMatteo Aldeghi, PhD, Director of Machine Learning Research, Bayer, matteo.aldeghi@bayer.com\nMatteo is broadly interested in the development of computational approaches that can accelerate pharmaceutical R&D, especially the application of machine learning to the design of new therapies, from small-molecule drugs to biological therapies. He is also interested in leveraging large biological datasets, like multi-omics data, to inform early therapeutic design decisions. Matteo has a expertise in biophysical simulations for drug discovery and biomolecular design, structure-based drug design, active learning applied to the chemical design, ML-guided experimental optimization, the development of graph neural networks for molecular property predictions, as well as broad knowledge of computational chemistry and cheminformatics. He was a reviewer for past NeurIPS workshops (e.g. AI for Accelerated Materials Design) and a key/primary organizer of a structure-based drug design workshop attended by approximately 120 academics and pharma industry professionals.\n\n\nAntong Chen, PhD. Merck\n\n\nAgata Miezaniec, PhD, Senior Business Development Manager, Ardigen, agata.miezaniec@ardigen.com\nAt Ardigen, Agata’s interest is to identify research and business value in their collaborations in areas of Artificial intelligence and Bioinformatics in drug discovery to help advance therapeutic development and bring life-altering medicines to patients sooner. Her personal past research interests were focused on energy metabolism and epigenetics on a molecular level. During her scientific career, Agata have co-organized several research and project management-oriented workshops and events at universities. the names, affiliations, and email addresses of the organizers, with one-paragraph statements of their research interests, areas of expertise, and experience in organizing workshops and related events; please indicate what other workshops (if any) are concurrently being proposed by an organizer\n\n\nMing Tommy Tang, PhD, Director of Computational Biology, Immunitas Therapeutics, mtang@immunitastx.com\nMing Tommy Tang is the Director of Computational Biology at Immunitas Therapeutics. At Immunitas, they employ a single-cell sequencing platform to dissect the biology of immune cells in human tumors. They use machine learning approaches to study single-cell RNA, single-cell TCR, and spatial transcriptome data for new target discovery. He is a computational biologist with extensive experience in genomics, epigenomics, and (single-cell) transcriptomics data. He has over ten years of computational biology experience and six years of wet lab experience. He uses R primarily for data wrangling and visualization in the tidyverse ecosystem; he uses Python for writing Snakemake workflows and reformatting data; he is a Unix geek learning shell tricks almost every month; he cares about reproducible research and open science. Prior to joining Immunitas, Tommy was at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard University, where he led a team to analyze immune-oncology-related single-cell sequencing datasets and spearheaded an NIH-funded project called Cancer Immunological Data Commons (CIDC).

    "text": "The human biology is arguably one of the most precious complex systems in existence that is both multi-scale and highly dynamic in nature. Though a full understanding of such a system eludes us at the present, modern medicine relies on sophisticated biosensors and data analytics methods. Generation of actionable insights into health and disease requires an interdisciplinary effort bringing together domain scientists and technologists.\nWith the unprecedented growth of available molecular assays (e.g. single cell m’omics, spatial omics, proteogenomics, and so on) and increasing availability of real world data, there is an essential need to develop methods and expertise in multi-omics analysis and integration, specially using ML/AI to bring together prior knowledge, disease biology and clinical data to actionable insights for drug discovery, diagnostics and prediction of response and resistance to treatments.\nIn this workshop, we will focus on multi-omics technologies and corresponding novel analytics approaches to help build integrative models of the systems biology in order to understand the healthy state and transition into a disease state, and how that differs between subgroups of individuals leading to development of more effective interventions specific to each subgroup."
